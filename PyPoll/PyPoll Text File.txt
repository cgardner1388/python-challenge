#Homework 2 PyPoll
 #The total number of votes cast
#A complete list of candidates who received votes
#The percentage of votes each candidate won
#The total number of votes each candidate won
#The winner of the election based on popular vote.
 
#currentDirectory = os.getcwd()
#print(currentDirectory)

#Questions
#1. Do I need to print the csvreader? 
#2. Do I need to skip over the header csvheader = next(csvreader)?
#3. Can you walk me through how I need to create the dictionaries and where to put them? 
#4. How do you format the data so that it looks similiar to the table in the homework?
